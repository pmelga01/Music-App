MLT Summer Project

## The Theme
The theme I chose was 'Nat King Cole' and 'Love' using the Genius Music API

## Issues encountered while making the project:
### Issue 1: Environment Variables setup
Learning about environment variables and being able to use them locally was something I've vaguely heard of but never used or valued in practice until this project! Though I didn't figure out how to store them locally automatically, I did, however, discover the usage of the 'source' command as well as making a hidden .env file and a helpful .gitignore file, as well as installing the package dot-env for python in order to reference my local machine's environment variable in my python code.

### Issue 2: Accessing AWS
I was not able to access AWS Cloud9 with an .edu email I knew would work concistently this summer, so I decided to use Ubuntu on my laptop and VSCode, I actually really enjoyed this option because it mirrors the environment I would prefer to use for future projects!

### Issue 3: Styling efficiently
I wanted my web page to have a clean and pleasing to look at format, and I decided to use Bootstrap to help practice and leverage this toolkit to have a more formal looking site 


## Known Problems:
I wanted to add an ease out animation with fade + slight movement with the container into place,
however, this was not working for me and isn't a huge priority

## Future plans for improvement:
I would love to make this site more interactive and incorporate more internal data structures to display information from the endpoint in a more interesting light, such as finding relations between artists and displaying them nicely, etc. It's also a little hard to come up with things that Genius does not already provide without slowing down the site and being useful to the client.

Adding more artists perhaps or a carousel of artists
